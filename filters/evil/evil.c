/* This is the heart of the algorithm, the function which corrupts
 * the buffer after reading it from the plugin.
 *
 * The observation is that if we have a block of (eg) size 10**6 bits
 * and our probability of finding a corrupt bit is (eg) 1/10**4, then
 * we expect approximately 100 bits in the block to be corrupted.
 *
 * For stuck bits we want the corrupted bits to be the same on each
 * access, either relative to the backing disk (STUCK_BITS) or to the
 * request (STUCK_WIRES).
 *
 * Instead of creating an expensive bitmap ahead of time covering the
 * whole disk, we can use the random number generator with a fixed
 * seed derived from the offset of the start of the block.  We can
 * then choose a random number uniformly in the range [0..2*(1/P)) (in
 * the example [0..2*10**4)) as the distance to the next corrupt bit.
 * We jump forwards, corrupt that bit, and repeat until we reach the
 * end of the block.
 *
 * "Corrupted" in this case can mean flipped by cosmic rays or stuck,
 * depending on the filter mode.
 *
 * On average this will choose the right number of bits in the block.
 * (Although their distribution will be suboptimal.  In a uniform
 * distribution it should be possible for two corrupted bits to be
 * greater than 2*(1/P) apart, but the above algorithm would not do
 * this.  Also this algorithm cannot corrupt two bits in the same
 * byte.  In practice this probably doesn't matter as long as P is
 * small.)
 *
 * Note that "block" != "buffer", especially in the STUCK_BITS mode.
 * We iterate over blocks as above, but only corrupt a bit when it
 * happens to coincide with the buffer we have just read.
 *
 * We choose the block size adaptively so that at least 100 bits in
 * the block will be corrupted.  The block size must be a power of 2.
 * The block size thus depends on the probability.
