# Test as many of the plugin options as possible.  We use a 'file:'
# protocol URL so curl won't use these settings, but this still
# exercises the paths inside the plugin.
#
# Notes:
# - cookie-script & header-script are tested separately
#
# - only some http-version & ssl-version options are supported in
#   all builds (should there be a way to detect?)
#
# - how to test tls13-ciphers?
