nbdkit for Debian
-----------------

Some tests that are run as part of the build process are built around
libguestfs. While libguestfs can only be used if a Linux kernel image
is found, the *guestfs* packages do not depend directly on linux-image
packages, so this source package adds the extra build dependencies
that are needed to run the tests.
