nbdkit-release-notes-1.24 - release notes for nbdkit 1.24

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the release notes for nbdkit stable release 1.24.
This describes the major changes since 1.22.

nbdkit 1.24.0 was released on B<7 January 2021>.

=head2 Security

There were no security issues found.  All past security issues and
information about how to report new ones can be found in
L<nbdkit-security(1)>.

=head2 Server

The server and a subset of the plugins and filters have been ported to
Windows using the Win32 API.  Only the mingw-w64 toolchain is
supported for building nbdkit (not MSVC).  You can also cross-compile
from Linux and test under Wine.  Some features are missing although it
is very usable.

New S<I<-D nbdkit.tls.log>> and S<I<-D nbdkit.tls.session>> debug
flags which enable additional debugging for TLS sessions.

The server now responds to C<NBD_INFO_NAME> (Eric Blake).

Options I<--run> and I<--vsock> may now be used together.

In I<--run>, C<$nbd> is now a synonym for C<$uri> instead of having
confusing magical properties.

=head2 Plugins

New L<nbdkit-S3-plugin(1)> to access disks stored on AWS S3 and Ceph.

New L<nbdkit-sparse-random-plugin(1)> which generates large disks
sparsely filled with random blocks of data.  These look like virtual
disk images and can be used to benchmark copying tools.

L<nbdkit-data-plugin(1)> has been greatly enhanced.  New features
include: C<(...)[N:M]> (slice syntax), assignments, comments,
variables, C<E<lt>(SCRIPT)> (inlined shell script).  In addition a
parse tree is built, allowing optimizations and other enhancements.
The plugin is now 64 bit clean allowing patterns larger than 2^32
bytes to work correctly.

L<nbdkit-random-plugin(1)> can now be used to test copying tools.

L<nbdkit-vddk-plugin(1)> supports enabling compression between VDDK
and the VMware server which in some situations can improve
performance.

=head2 Filters

New L<nbdkit-exportname-filter(1)> can be used to extend, mask and
modify the exports exposed by a plugin (Eric Blake).

New L<nbdkit-exitwhen-filter(1)> allowing the server to gracefully
exit on various events including external scripts.

New L<nbdkit-checkwrite-filter(1)> can be used to benchmark copying
tools.

L<nbdkit-ip-filter(1)> now supports filtering clients by PID, user ID
or group ID, for clients connected over a Unix domain socket.  Also
you can filter clients using C<AF_VSOCK> and vsock port number.

L<nbdkit-log-filter(1)> now logs C<get_ready>, C<after_fork> and
C<preconnect> methods, and there is a new C<logscript> feature
allowing scripts to be run on logging events.

L<nbdkit-ext2-filter(1)> new option C<ext2file=exportname> can be used
to allow the client to select which file to see from the filesystem
using the NBD export name (Eric Blake).

=head2 Language bindings

Python style cleanups (Eric Blake).

The OCaml plugin now correctly acquires and releases the GC lock on
all paths in and out.

There is a new OCaml C<NBDKit.version> function returning the version
of nbdkit that the plugin was compiled against.

Multiple enhancements to the Rust plugin (Alan Somers).

=head2 API

New C<.list_exports>, C<.default_export> and C<.export_description>
plugin methods allowing plugins to be queried about what export names
they support, and give additional descriptions of exports.  New
C<nbdkit_use_default_export> helper function (Eric Blake).

New C<nbdkit_strdup_intern>, C<nbdkit_strndup_intern>
C<nbdkit_printf_intern> and C<nbdkit_vprintf_intern> functions which
allow you to allocate a string in a plugin without worrying about
freeing it (Eric Blake).

New C<nbdkit_peer_pid>, C<nbdkit_peer_uid> and C<nbdkit_peer_gid>
allows plugins and filters to read the clientâ€™s credentials, for
clients connected over a Unix domain socket.

=head2 Tests

Many tests now use L<libnbd(3)>, L<nbdsh(1)>, L<nbdinfo(1)> and
L<nbdcopy(1)> as lighter weight replacements for qemu tools.

Fix compatibility with qemu E<gt> 5.2.0.

=head2 Build

Downstream packagers can now use this to add extra downstream
information which is printed in version strings etc:
 ./configure --with-extra=...

If L<ocamldoc(1)> is installed at build time, then it will be used to
build the L<NBDKit(3)> manual page for OCaml documentation.
